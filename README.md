Workout
===========

This exercise tracking sample app lets users enter bodybuilding workout details and persist them to the backend. 

This app was built for our 10-minute webinar series. To find out more, contact support@kinvey.com. 


## Features Demonstrated
This app demonstrates basic CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Destroy) operations on individual workouts. This uses a Data Store Kinvey feature and a collection called "workouts" to store the data created by a user. Workout entities list the time & date of the exercise along with the weight lifted and the number of reps in the set. These are sorted by body zone. 

## System Requirements

* iOS 5+ 
* KinveyKit 1.17.2

## Setup
No Additional Setup is needed beyond adding a new Kinvey backend credentials to `AppDelegate.m`.
